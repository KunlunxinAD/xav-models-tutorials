## Missing evidence to verify before making claims

- Do not infer benchmark, accuracy, memory usage, throughput, image tag, or exact software version unless it is stated in the source tutorial.
- If multiple tutorials for this model disagree, record the conflict in `wiki/log.md` before normalizing the model page.
